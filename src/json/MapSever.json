Numerous objects which have been designated by the cantons as being of regional or local importance also form part of the IHR but not of the federal inventory. You can find more information about the inventory via the following link: http://www.ivs.admin.ch/. The complete dataset of the inventory can be displayed in the following WebGIS application and also downloaded: http://ivs-gis.admin.ch (see Article 4 of the ITRO). | Bundesinventar der historischen Verkehrswege der Schweiz (IVS) | swisstopo | Federal Office of Topography swisstopo | Federal Roads Office | ",

Following the devastating events of the summer of 1987, which caused major damage in many regions of Switzerland, the Operational Hydrology Working Group (GHO) proposed that a bedload transport database should be set up. The SOLID database was developed by the FOEN in collaboration with the cantonal authorities and research institutes, which provide data on the amount of material transported or deposited in sediment traps. The amounts are estimated with the aid of measuring instruments or by emptying these traps. The SOLID database comprises records from about a hundred sediment traps. | Geschiebemessnetz (SOLID) - Standorte der Messstellen | swisstopo | Federal Office of Topography swisstopo | Federal Office for the Environment FOEN | ","inspireUpperName":"Surface representation","inspireName":"Hydrography","urlApplication":"http://map.bafu.admin.ch"},"idGeoCat":"05ba053f-60ca-492b-a1f5-bd70f6de8761","layerBodId":"ch.bafu.feststoffe-geschiebemessnetz","fullName":"Database of total bedload (federal government)","name":"Total bedload database (CH)"},{"attributes":{"wmsUrlResource":"https://wms.geo.admin.ch/?REQUEST=GetCapabilities&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.0.0","scaleLimit":"-","inspireUpperAbstract":"Surface representation","urlDetails":"http://www.bafu.admin.ch/floz-de","bundCollectionNumber":"-- z.B. 123.4 -- (siehe Sammlung Geobasisdatens\u00e4tze)","inspireAbstract":"Hydrography","dataOwner":"Federal Office for the Environment FOEN","wmsContactAbbreviation":"swisstopo","downloadUrl":"http://www.bafu.admin.ch/wasser/13462/13496/16044/index.html?lang=de","maps":"api,bafu,ech,gewiss,inspire,wms-bgdi","wmsContactName":"Federal Office of Topography swisstopo","dataStatus":"20140805","fullTextSearch":"Strahler stream order | The stream order according to Strahler specifies the degree of branching of a hydrographic network.

In addition, it also leads to increased production of nitrous oxide. Methods for establishing critical loads for nitrogen are developed and applied in the framework of the UNECE convention on long-range transboundary air pollution.The map shows the exceedances of the critical loads for nitrogen for sensitive ecosystems for the reference year 2015 in a resolution of 1 square kilometre. Critical loads only apply for areas containing sensitive ecosystems. The inventories of the following sensitive ecosystems were used for the map: i) Raised bogs and fens from the Federal Inventories of Raised and Transitional Bogs and Fenlands; ii) Dry grasslands from the National Inventory of Dry Grasslands; iii) Various types of vegetation declared worthy of protection, from the vegetation atlas by Hegg et al. (1993); iv) Sites containing mountain hay meadows that are part of the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring (122 sites); v) Oligotrophic alpine lakes in southern Switzerland (100 lakes); vi) National Forest Inventory sites (10331 sites) and 301 additional sites used for dynamic modelling. Sensitive ecosystems that are not included in these datasets are not considered. Detailed information about the model can be found in the report Critical Loads of Nitrogen and their Exceedances. Actual critical load exceedances can deviate from the modelled grid data.

The wind rose shows the relative frequency of the modelled wind directions. The averaged wind speeds and corresponding Weibull parameters are visible for each sector. The calculation of wind speeds and directions is based on long-term measurements that have been incorporated into the models. Because the measurement points are not available everywhere throughout the country at a suitable density, and inaccuracies can occur in the modelling of wind flows in complex terrain, the results are subject to uncertainties. These range from +/- 0.5 metres per second in the Jura range, +/- 0.8 metres per second in the central plain and +/- 1.0 metres per second in the pre-Alps, to +/- 1.5 metres per second in the Alps. For maps at heights of more than 100 metres above the ground, significantly fewer measurements are available for modelling purposes, and this leads to increased uncertainties in the results. The data have to be regarded as rough estimates of the wind conditions. To assess the wind conditions at a specific location, measurement on site is therefore essential. |  | swisstopo | Federal Office of Topography swisstopo | Swiss Federal Office of Energy | ","inspireUpperName":"Energy and economy","inspireName":"Energy resources","urlApplication":"https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=de&topic=energie&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-grau&catalogNodes=2419,2420,2427,2480,2429,2431,2434,2436,2767,2441,3206&layers=ch.bfe.windenergie-geschwindigkeit_h75&layers_opacity=0.75"},"idGeoCat":"d5892cf4-38fa-4af7-9ddb-f87dd2ed06cd","layerBodId":"ch.bfe.windenergie-geschwindigkeit_h75","fullName":"Wind Atlas of Switzerland: Annual average of the modelled wind speed and direction at a height of 75 metres above the ground","name":"Wind speed 75 metres above ground"},{"attributes":{"wmsUrlResource":"https://wms.geo.admin.ch/?REQUEST=GetCapabilities&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.0.0","scaleLimit":"1:25'000","inspireUpperAbstract":"Energy and economy","urlDetails":"http://www.bfe.admin.ch/geoinformation/","abstract":"The wind energy concept is a concept in accordance with Art. 13 of the Swiss Spatial Planning Act (SPA, SR 700).
